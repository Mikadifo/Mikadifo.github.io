          Hi there! I’m a software engineer with over 3 years of experience. As
          a freelance front end developer I help small businesses and solo
          founders reach more customers by building custom landing pages and web
          apps.
          <br />
          <br />
          I always wanted to know how things work and that curiosity helped me
          learn new technologies faster. All started by creating a game with
          python following the instructions in a book. Then I learned how to
          build websites, which I didn’t know how to design, so I learned UI/UX.
          Now I’m working with hardware, understanding how computers work.
          <br />
          <br />
          My main goal is to build tools, apps, and websites that can actually
          have an impact in the world and help people achieve their goals. I
          also like to help in non-profit organizations, so feel free to contact
          me about these types of projects.
