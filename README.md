# Mikadifo Website
My personal website where I show my works throughout my professional career.

# Dev Setup
1. Install NodeJS if you don't have it already.
2. Install http-server globally. `npm install http-server -g`
3. Run the server with the following command. `http-server`
4. Go to *http://127.0.0.1:8080/* or *localhost:8080/*

# Contribuing
Everyone can freely suggest changes on the project, I'll really appreciate that.

# Future
Now the website is static showing my basic info and projects I made, but in a future could be a personal blog and also where I publish my next apps.
