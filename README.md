# Mikadifo Website
My personal website where I show my works throughout my professional career.

# Contribuing
Everyone can freely suggest changes on the project, I'll really appreciate that.

# Future
Now the website is static showing my basic info and projects I made, but in a future could be a personal blog and also where I publish my next apps.
